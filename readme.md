# programming assignment 4

this program creates a basic poker game, in which the user will be able
to enter a hand, and the program will format that hand, calculate
the best poker hand that the input provides, and returns the name
of that hand (straight flush, two pair, etc.). from there, it will also
allow the input of a second hand, and will test to see whether the first
or second hand ranks higher, and which one in turn wins.
